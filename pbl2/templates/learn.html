  <h1>Learn Page Replacement Algorithms</h1>
  
  <div class="intro-section tutorial-card">
      <h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
      <p>In modern operating systems, virtual memory allows programs to address memory as if it were contiguous and much larger than physical memory. This is achieved through a technique called **paging**, where memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called **pages** (for programs) and **frames** (for physical memory).</p>
      <p>When a program tries to access a page that is not currently in physical memory, a **page fault** occurs. The operating system must then load the required page from secondary storage (like a hard drive) into a free memory frame. If all frames are occupied, the system must decide which existing page to **replace** to make room for the new one. This decision is made by a **page replacement algorithm**.</p>
      <p>The goal of these algorithms is to minimize the number of page faults, as disk access is significantly slower than memory access, impacting overall system performance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tutorial-grid">
    <div class="tutorial-card">
      <div class="tutorial-header">
        <h2>First In, First Out (FIFO)</h2>
        <div class="difficulty">Beginner</div>
      </div>
      <div class="tutorial-content">
        <div class="algorithm-intro">
          <p>FIFO is the simplest page replacement algorithm. It replaces the page that has been in memory for the longest time, regardless of how much it is being used.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="algorithm-details">
          <h3>How It Works (Steps)</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>When a page is referenced:
              <ul>
                <li>**If the page is in memory (Page Hit):** No change to memory, page fault count remains the same. The page remains in its current position in the queue.</li>
                <li>**If the page is not in memory (Page Fault):**</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If there are empty frames available in memory:
              <ul>
                <li>The new page is loaded into an empty frame and added to the 'end' of the FIFO queue.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If memory is full:
              <ul>
                <li>The page at the 'front' of the FIFO queue (the oldest page) is removed from memory.</li>
                <li>The new page is loaded into the freed frame and added to the 'end' of the queue.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Performance Characteristics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>**Pros:**
              <ul>
                <li>Simplest to understand and implement.</li>
                <li>Low overhead, as it only requires a queue to track page entry order.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Cons:**
              <ul>
                <li>Doesn't consider page usage; it might remove frequently used pages, leading to more page faults.</li>
                <li>Suffers from **Belady's Anomaly**: Increasing the number of frames can sometimes lead to an increase in page faults, which is counter-intuitive.</li>
                <li>Performance can be poor for certain access patterns (e.g., if a page is frequently accessed but was loaded early).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Use Cases:** Rarely used in modern general-purpose operating systems due to its limitations, but might be seen in very simple embedded systems.</li>

        <div class="algorithm-intro">
          <p>LRU replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period of time. It operates on the principle of locality: if a page was used recently, it's likely to be used again soon. It tries to approximate the Optimal algorithm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="algorithm-details">
          <h3>How It Works (Steps)</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>For every page reference, the system keeps track of its last access time (either with a timestamp or by maintaining a linked list where most recently used is at the front).</li>
            <li>When a page is referenced:
              <ul>
                <li>**If the page is in memory (Page Hit):** Update its last access time to the current time (or move it to the front of the list).</li>
                <li>**If the page is not in memory (Page Fault):**</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>The new page is loaded into an empty frame, and its access time is recorded (or added to the front of the list).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If memory is full:
              <ul>
                <li>Identify the page in memory with the oldest (least recent) access time (or the page at the end of the list).</li>
                <li>Remove that page.</li>
                <li>Load the new page into the freed frame and record its access time (or add it to the front of the list).</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Generally performs very well, often considered one of the best practical algorithms because it leverages locality of reference.</li>
                <li>Does not suffer from Belady's Anomaly (increasing frames always leads to fewer or equal faults).</li>
                <li>Provides a good approximation of the Optimal algorithm.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Cons:**
              <ul>
                <li>More complex and expensive to implement compared to FIFO.</li>
                <li>Requires hardware support (e.g., counters or timestamps) or significant software overhead (e.g., maintaining a linked list) to accurately keep track of access times.</li>
                <li>Maintaining the exact order of access for every page can be resource-intensive, especially for large numbers of pages.</li>

        <h2>Key Concepts & Glossary</h2>
        <div class="algorithm-details">
            <ul>
                <li>**Virtual Memory:** An operating system technique that allows a program to use more memory than is physically available in the system. It achieves this by swapping data between RAM and secondary storage (e.g., hard disk). This creates the illusion of a very large, contiguous address space.</li>
                <li>**Paging:** A memory management scheme that divides the computer's physical memory into fixed-size blocks called "frames" and a program's logical memory into same-size blocks called "pages." Data is transferred between physical and secondary storage in units of pages/frames.</li>
                <li>**Page:** A fixed-size block of a program's virtual address space. When a program runs, its code and data are broken down into pages.</li>
                <li>**Page Frame:** A fixed-size block of physical memory (RAM). Pages from a program are loaded into these frames.</li>
                <li>**Page Fault:** An event that occurs when a running program attempts to access a page that is not currently loaded into physical memory (RAM). This signals the operating system to retrieve the required page from secondary storage.</li>
                <li>**Reference String:** A sequence of page numbers that a program accesses. This string is used as input to simulate and evaluate the performance of different page replacement algorithms.</li>
                <li>**Locality of Reference:** The principle stating that a processor tends to access the same set of memory locations repetitively over a short period of time. This can be temporal (reusing data soon) or spatial (accessing data near recently accessed data). Efficient page replacement algorithms leverage this principle.</li>
                <li>**Hit Ratio:** The ratio of page hits (when a requested page is found in memory) to the total number of page references. A higher hit ratio indicates more efficient memory utilization and fewer disk accesses.</li>
                <li>**Fault Rate:** The ratio of page faults (when a requested page is not found in memory) to the total number of page references. A lower fault rate is desirable as page faults are costly operations due to disk I/O.</li>
                <li>**Thrashing:** A debilitating condition in virtual memory systems where the system spends most of its time swapping pages between main memory and secondary storage, rather than performing useful work. This typically occurs when the working set of processes exceeds available physical memory.</li>
                <li>**Working Set:** The set of pages that a process is actively using at a given point in time. An effective memory management strategy aims to keep the working set of all active processes in physical memory to minimize page faults and prevent thrashing.</li>
                <li>**Dirty Bit (Modified Bit):** A flag associated with each page in memory. It's set to 1 if the page has been modified since it was loaded. If a dirty page needs to be replaced, its content must first be written back to secondary storage, making its replacement more costly.</li>
